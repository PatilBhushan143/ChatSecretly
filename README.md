# ChatSecretly
The advancement in technology has brought a revolution in the way people 
communicate. With the advent of instant messaging and social media, people are 
now able to connect with each other from all over the world in real-time. However, 
the increasing use of these platforms has also raised concerns about privacy and 
security. To address these concerns, many developers have started to create secure 
and private messaging applications that allow users to communicate without 
worrying about the security of their messages.
One such application is the Peer-to-Peer Secure Chatting Application, which 
is a secure and private way for users to communicate with each other. The 
application is developed using Java Swing for the graphical user interface and 
MySQL for the database storage. The security of the communication between the 
peers is ensured through encryption of the messages using secure algorithms.
This project aims to provide a secure and private platform for users to 
communicate with each other without having to worry about the security of their 
messages. The user-friendly interface, developed using Java Swing, makes it easy 
for users to use the application, while the database storage, using MySQL, ensures 
that the chat history is persistently stored even if the user closes the application.
Furthermore, the application requires users to authenticate themselves before 
they can start chatting. The authentication is performed by checking the credentials 
stored in the MySQL database, which is protected using secure authentication 
methods to prevent unauthorized access.
